Greetings,

Allow me to introduce myselfâ€”Hanzla Shahid. Currently enrolled as a 1st-year student, I embarked on my journey into the realm of Web Development in August 2023. My exploration commenced with the fundamental HTML (Hypertext Markup Language), progressing seamlessly to CSS, Javascript, and culminating with proficiency in the renowned Javascript Library, React Js. Presently, I am delving into backend development with Node Js. This serves as a brief overview of my educational and professional endeavors.

Thank you for your attention.
